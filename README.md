Android/Desktop SDL2-based C++11 Project
=========================================

A WIP project to work to do game development targetting Android/Linux,
with the intention to be easily extended to OSX, iOS, Win7.

The framework will rely on the following libraries

SDL_mixer (sound)
SDL_image (png/jpg loading)
GLM       (math library similar to GLSL)
bullet    (physics)
